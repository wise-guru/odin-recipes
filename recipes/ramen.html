    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Ramen noodles: a favortite for people from all walks of life. It may seem like a difficult dish to get <em>just right</em>, but with my help you'll be taking in all that sodium in no time!</p>

        <p>The best part? You don't have to deal with any pesky pots or pans!</p>    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Maruchan ramen noodles</li>
            <li>Seasoning</li>
            <li>Water</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil some water with a kettle. (You can skip this stwp if you would rather use the microwave.)</li>
            <li>Break up your ramen noodle block while it's still in the packaging.</li>
            <li>Empty the packaging into your bowl of choice. (Make sure to take the seasoning packet out!)</li>
            <li>Open and pour the seasoning packet (or any seasonong of your choice) onto the noodles. I often add a bit of Peanut butter or PB powder.</li>
            <li>Pour the water onto the noodles. How much water, you ask? I don't know. I usually eyeball it. </li>
            <li>Put a lid of some sort on the bowl and wait 15 minutes. If you didn't boil the water, this is where you would microwave it for around 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once cooled, dig in to your culinary masterpiece.</li>
        </ol>
