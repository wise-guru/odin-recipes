    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe is for a bowl of cereal. Specifically, a bowl of Reese's puffs! This is one of my favorite kinds of cereals. A perfect mix of peanut butter and chocolate.</p>

        <p>It's been passed down from generation to generation in my family, but the time has come to finally share this recipe with everyone.</p>
